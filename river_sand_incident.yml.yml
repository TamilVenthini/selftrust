citizen_output:
  impact_message: >
    Impact level has crossed the HIGH threshold.
    Although no immediate harm is visible,
    long-term environmental damage is actively accumulating.

  responsibility_message: >
    Continued silence and normalization of repeated violations
    has contributed to erosion of collective environmental trust.

  score_message: >
    Your Civic Trust Score is 60 out of 100.
    This reflects moderate decline in civic responsibility.

  improvement_guidance: >
    To improve your score, increase visibility through reporting,
    discourage normalization, and support local commons protection.
