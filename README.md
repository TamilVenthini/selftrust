\### Constitutional Drift Detector for Everyday Observations

\##  What is SelfTrust? 



SelfTrust is a simple civic awareness website.



When you observe something in daily life and feel

“Is this okay?” or “Does this matter?”



-> You describe what you saw.

-> The system explains:



\* Which law intent is involved

\* Where public trust is drifting

\* Whether the impact is LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH

\* What your role is (witness / authority)

\* What you can do next, responsibly

\### What You Describe 



Only what you saw.

No judgement. No accusation.



Example:



> “Night-time sand extraction using bullock cart.”

\### What the System Does 



\* Matches keywords (Tamil + English)

\* Identifies the closest real-world scenario

\* Maps it to law intent

\* Detects trust boundary drift

\* Calculates impact level

\* Suggests non-confrontational civic actions

\##  What This App Is NOT 



This is NOT a police app

It does NOT file complaints or FIRs

It does NOT label anyone as a criminal



-> This is a thinking and awareness system

-> It connects law with everyday life



---



\##  PPDTF Framework 



SelfTrust analyzes situations using five lenses:



\* People – Who is involved?

\* Process – Were rules followed?

\* Data – Is there evidence or visibility?

\* Technology – Are detection systems present?

\* Facility – Is this a shared public resource?



---





\##  Simple Example 



You observe sand being taken from a river at night.



SelfTrust explains:



\* Rivers are public resources

\* Damage may be slow but big impact

\* Silence does not mean no impact

\* You are a witness

\* Your inaction reduces civic trust

\* Small actions can restore trust



---



\##  Why SelfTrust Matters 



\-> Societies collapse not when crime happens, but when crime becomes normal



SelfTrust highlights problems/intent before they become irreversible.



---





\##  One-Line Summary



English:



-> SelfTrust helps citizens understand how everyday observations silently affect law, trust, and shared resources — and what responsible action looks like.

\##  Final Note



SelfTrust is not about punishment.

It is about early understanding of the intent of society.
